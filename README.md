# Virtual DOM for Elm

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elm-lang/virtual-dom.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/elm-lang/virtual-dom)

In the past, application developers needed to mess with the DOM by hand. This introduced a variety of possible pitfalls:

  * Touching the DOM can be extremely slow. For example, if you change the DOM and *then* try to read some information from it, you usually need to reflow everything to ensure that the data is "up to date". This makes it extremely easy for innocent-looking code to be extremely slow.

  * Touching the DOM is very error prone. By splitting your applicationâ€™s state between the DOM and your program, you are more likely to lose track of what is going on and have bad emergent architecture.

 So **Virtual DOM** has you build up a representation of the DOM on each frame instead. With some pretty simple performance tricks, this ends up being quite a lot faster than naive hand-written code and lead to much better architecture overall.
